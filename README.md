RoadTrip-LetsGo

Description of the project:
Put driving(walking, biking) route and points of interest together.

What does the app do?
This app can tell you dining/gas station etc. choices (within certain distance or driving time) along the driving route so that user can dine/pump gas etc. and still reach destination on time.
The choices will be presented on the map as well as listed with highlight information and user can click in to get more information. We will use Yelp, Foursquare etc. APIs. 
The idea is straight forward and basic scope/user stories are well defined, but much more feature can be added. 

Basic user stories:
1. User can specify starting location(or current location), destination and the kind of stops they are interested(such as gas station, Restaurant, hotel etc.). 
2. The route will first show up, then the candidate stops will show up within a certain range of the route. A more detailed query (such as thai restaurant) can be applied to limit the number of results. 
3. Users can click on the candidate stops on the map then a highlight will pop up (such as location, rating, business hour, phone number etc.) 
4. Users can also click to get the list information of all possible stops and clicking item will present detailed information about the business.
5. There are general filters that can be applied such as minimum rating, search range, price range, data sources (yelp, foursquare or other resources), transportation types etc. 
6. Filters can be saved, updated and reset.
